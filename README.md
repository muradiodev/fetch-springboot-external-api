# The Task

Given API endpoint:
```
https://api-origin.onefootball.com/score-one-proxy/api/teams/en/{team_id}.json
```

with the following characteristics:
- The team ID (`team_id`) is an **unsigned** integer.
- The team IDs are sequential.
- Some team IDs respond with errors.

Using the above API endpoint, find the following teams by name:
* Germany
* England
* France
* Spain
* Manchester United
* Arsenal
* Chelsea
* Barcelona
* Real Madrid
* Bayern Munich

Extract all the players from the given teams and render to **stdout** the information about players ordered by their **playerID**.

Each player entry should contain the following information: 

```
playerID; full name; age; list of teams
```

The goal of the task is to print the players of the **given teams**. 
If there is a team overlap (e.g. a player plays in Germany and Chelsea), then print both teams.

**Output Example:**
```
1. 6232; Bernd Leno; 29; Arsenal, Germany
2. 6683; Alexander Mustermann; 25; France, Manchester Utd
3. 8010; Marcelo; 33; Real Madrid
4. ...
```

## FAQs

**Submission**
* The solution should use the **latest** version of Go.
* Feel free to use third-party libraries for the solution.
* Code should be tested and well documentated.
* Using concurrency in the solution is optional.
* The API Endpoint URL and the list of teams should be easily configurable in the solution.

**API**
* Discovering the valid team IDs is a part of the task.
* All teams on the requested list can be found through the API endpoint.
* The solution should not scan all the IDs on the API; only enough to get information about all the teams listed.
* Some API calls might return errors, your code should handle that gracefully.
* It's safe to assume that a player can be a part of maximum of 2 teams.
